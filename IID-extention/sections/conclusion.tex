\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper we empirically validated
the wide existence of inefficient image displaying (IID) issues in open-source Android apps,
and studied their root causes, manifestations, and common anti-patterns.
Based on these empirical findings,
we developed a static IID issue detector TAPIR and evaluated it with real-world apps. The experimental evaluation shows encouraging results: TAPIR detected both previously known IID issues with a high accuracy and previously unknown IID issues confirmed in practice.
